      answer: "👉 Exam favorite",
      codeExample: `
⭐ Types of JDBC Drivers

JDBC drivers are used to connect Java applications with databases.
There are four types of JDBC drivers:

1️⃣ JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver (Type 1)

This driver uses ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) to connect Java application with database.

Working:

Java Program → JDBC → ODBC → Database

Advantages:

✔ Easy to use
✔ Useful for learning JDBC

Disadvantages:

❌ Slow performance
❌ Needs ODBC installed
❌ Not suitable for web applications
❌ Not used in real projects

📌 Note:
This driver is deprecated and not used now.



2️⃣ Native API Driver (Type 2)

This driver uses database’s native libraries.

Working:

Java Program → JDBC → Native API → Database

Advantages:

✔ Better performance than Type 1
✔ Direct communication with database

Disadvantages:

❌ Platform dependent
❌ Requires native libraries on client machine

📌 Example:
Oracle OCI driver



3️⃣ Network Protocol Driver (Type 3)

This driver uses a middleware server to connect Java application and database.

Working:

Java Program → JDBC → Middleware → Database

Advantages:

✔ No database driver needed on client
✔ Can connect to multiple databases

Disadvantages:

❌ Slower due to network
❌ Middleware setup is costly



4️⃣ Thin Driver (Type 4) ⭐⭐

This driver is written completely in Java and communicates directly with the database.

Working:

Java Program → JDBC → Database

Advantages:

✔ Platform independent
✔ High performance
✔ No extra software required
✔ Most widely used driver

Disadvantages:

❌ Database-specific driver required

📌 Example:
MySQL Connector/J

      question: "4. Explain Steps to establish JDBC connection. 👉 With method names (Class.forName, getConnection, createStatement)",
      answer: "",
      codeExample: `
⭐ Steps to Establish JDBC Connection

To connect a Java application with a database using JDBC, we follow 5 main steps.



1️⃣ Load and Register the Driver

👉 Method: Class.forName()

This step loads the JDBC driver class into memory.

Why needed?

  So Java knows which database driver to use

Method used:
Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");


📌 In simple words:
This step tells Java: “Use MySQL driver”.



2️⃣ Establish Connection

👉 Method: DriverManager.getConnection()

This step creates a connection between Java program and database.

Method used:
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);


📌 In simple words:
This step connects Java to database using URL, username, and password.



3️⃣ Create Statement

👉 Method: createStatement()

This step creates a Statement object to send SQL queries to the database.

Method used:
Statement st = con.createStatement();


📌 In simple words:
Statement is used to execute SQL commands.



4️⃣ Execute SQL Query

👉 Methods:

executeQuery() → for SELECT
executeUpdate() → for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

Example:
ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM student");


📌 In simple words:
This step runs SQL query on database.



5️⃣ Close the Connection

👉 Method: close()

This step closes all opened resources.

Example:
con.close();


📌 In simple words:
This step releases database resources.

| Close            | close()             | Free resources        |


⭐ One-line Exam Answer (Very Useful)

JDBC connection is established by loading the driver, creating a connection using getConnection(), 
creating a statement using createStatement(), executing SQL queries, and finally closing the 
connection.




✅ Full JDBC Program (Using Thin Driver – MySQL)

// Step 1: Import required packages
import java.sql.*;

class JDBCExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        try {
            // Step 2: Load and Register JDBC Driver
            Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
            // Driver class loaded into memory

            // Step 3: Establish Connection
            String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/college";
            String user = "root";
            String password = "root";

            Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
            // Connection created between Java and Database

            // Step 4: Create Statement
            Statement st = con.createStatement();
            // Statement object created to execute SQL query

            // Step 5: Execute SQL Query
            ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM student");

            // Step 6: Process ResultSet
            while (rs.next()) {
                System.out.println(
                    rs.getInt(1) + " " +
                    rs.getString(2) + " " +
                    rs.getInt(3)
                );
            }

            // Step 7: Close Connections
            rs.close();
            st.close();
            con.close();

        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("Driver not found");
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            System.out.println("Database error");
        }
    }
}

      answer: "👉 High-scoring + short writing",
      codeExample: `
  ⭐ Statement vs PreparedStatement vs CallableStatement

These are JDBC interfaces used to execute SQL queries.


1️⃣ Statement

Statement is used to execute simple SQL queries without parameters.

Features:

SQL query written at runtime
No parameters
Slower execution
Not secure (SQL Injection possible)

Example:

Statement st = con.createStatement();
st.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM student");



2️⃣ PreparedStatement

PreparedStatement is used to execute pre-compiled SQL queries with parameters.

Features:

SQL query written once
Supports parameters (?)
Faster than Statement
More secure

Example:

PreparedStatement ps = con.prepareStatement(
    "SELECT * FROM student WHERE id=?"
);
ps.setInt(1, 101);
ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();



3️⃣ CallableStatement

CallableStatement is used to execute stored procedures in the database.

Features:

Calls stored procedures
Supports IN, OUT parameters
Used for complex operations
Faster for repeated tasks

Example:

CallableStatement cs = con.prepareCall("{call getStudent(?)}");
cs.setInt(1, 101);
ResultSet rs = cs.executeQuery();
